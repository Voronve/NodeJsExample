# NodeJs Example
stack: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

In this simple example I made a few CRUDs for different types of activities and services such as Cources, Masterclasses and others.
Also we can create a customer, and bind him to a particular activity.

## installation:

```bash
# Install dependencies with npm

$ npm install
```

## run:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

In order to use the functional of this example, you may use a Postman for making requests (json file with ready-to-use 
requests is located in the core level of this project - Example_postman_collection.json) and mongoDB database, either local or remote (you should write the 
correct adress to your database in varables.env file)
